#  Azure VNet to VNet Peering Project

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to create **VNet to VNet Peering** in Microsoft Azure.
VNet peering allows two virtual networks to communicate with each other securely using Azure's backbone network.

---

# Objective

* Understand Azure Virtual Networks (VNet)
* Configure VNet Peering between two VNets
* Enable communication between resources in different networks

---

# Services Used

* Azure Virtual Network
* Subnets
* Network Security Groups (NSG)
* Azure Portal

---

# Architecture

* VNet-1 (Region A)
* VNet-2 (Region B or same region)
* Peering connection between both VNets

---

# Step-by-Step Implementation

# Step 1: Create VNet-1

* Go to Azure Portal
* Create a Virtual Network
* Add address space (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
* Create subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)

# Step 2: Create VNet-2

* Create another VNet
* Use different address space (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16)
* Add subnet

# Step 3: Configure VNet Peering

* Go to VNet-1 → Peerings → Add

* Connect to VNet-2

* Enable:

  * Allow virtual network access
  * Allow forwarded traffic (optional)

* Repeat same from VNet-2

# Step 4: Verify Connection

* Deploy VM in both VNets
* Try ping or SSH/RDP between them

# Key Learnings

* VNet peering is fast and private
* No need for VPN gateway
* Works across regions
